					<p class="intro">
						Medical imaging is a vital diagnostic tool: x-rays, mammograms, ultrasounds and computed tomography images all help diagnose patients' injuries and diseases. But applying the appropriate medical imaging procedure for each patient requires skill. This is why diagnostic medical radiation technologists (MRTs) are highly sought after, and not just in New Zealand.
