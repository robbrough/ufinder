						Cover all aspects of care from health, hygiene, behaviour and handling, to selecting the perfect pet. Natural Sciences focuses on the study and conservation of plants and animals. It's about understanding and protecting our environment by learning more about it. It could mean working in an environmental role to conserve regional parks, advise government on ecological issues, or protect native flora and fauna from bio hazards.
