                Training as a carpenter gives you the  skill set to be able to build houses and commercial properties. Or you could specialise in boat building, refitting or working on motorboats and super yachts. Furniture and cabinetmakers are needed for all sorts of different projects. </p>
            </p>
            <p>You could make and repair furniture for homes, fit out businesses, or build the interior of boats. Some cabinetmakers choose to become specialists – for example as kitchen or stairmakers – dependant on what they enjoy.
