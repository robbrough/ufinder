					<p class="intro">
						Love working on boats, cars, buildings, or heavy machinery?</br> You could become an automotive engineer or technician working as a mechanic, repairing transmissions, brakes, steering and suspension. 
					</p>
						
					</p>
						Specialize in auto electronics and you’ll diagnose electrical faults and provide advice on electronic transmission and fuel injection.  Taking to the water, boating is big in New Zealand – four in ten Kiwis own a boat. So there’s plenty of work designing, building and repairing them.  Fabrication engineers and welders make and install metal parts like vents, handrails and boilers. They also make parts for aeroplanes and boats.
