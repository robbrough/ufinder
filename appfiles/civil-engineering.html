						Civil engineers play a major role in how our cities look. They plan, model and manage everything from motorways and airports to harbours and bridges. 
					</p>
					<p>
						They analyse the way these structures are likely to behave once they're built, and choose the best materials and construction methods for each design. Alongside Civil Engineers, Surveyors play a major role in how our world looks too. They map the earthâ€™s surface and collect information about land, water and other natural resources.
